			"When my CEO asked me to build a new website for our company, I was excited to take on the challenge and honored to be trusted with it.",

			"I also wanted to make the site as fast as possible, so I used Nuxt 3's static site generation feature to pre-render all the pages and improve SEO.",
			"The result is a fast, responsive, and accessible website that showcases our work and values."

			"This was my first project with Nuxt 3. It was a complete rebuild of a prototype built in Vue 2 so there was quite a challenge in terms of rethinking the architecture.",
			"The project called for site translation, which required setting up localization not only in the frontend, but also in our Sanity instance for images and videos.",
			"Ultimately, the static site generation of NUXT 3 was a great fit for this project as it allowed us to create a fast and SEO-friendly site that could be easily deployed to Firebase."
