	"bio1": "As a creative technologist, I am constantly adapting my skillset to build many projects in many different formats. I am a full-stack developer, with strong skills in Typescript and an eye for clean design. I am proficient in modern front-end libraries and frameworks like NUXT/Vue3, React/Next.js and Svelte/SvelteKit. I especially enjoy building interactive data visualizations to transform information that is abstract and inaccessible into something that is insightful and understandable. If my time in web development has taught me anything, it is that I will be happily learning for the rest of my life.",
	"bio2": "Before pivoting to software engineering in 2021, I was a freelance director of photography and camera operator in television for over twelve years. I was lucky enough to travel the globe filming for numerous networks including AMC, Max, NatGeo and Comedy Central. When not building out new websites, I can be found playing hockey, doing the crossword or going for a family jog with my wife and kids.",
